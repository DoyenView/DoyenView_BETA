# 🌍 Hello, World.

Welcome, traveler.

You've stumbled into a live module from a larger system — one that doesn’t make much noise, but moves with purpose.

This is not a full application. It's a **window into a deeper machine**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

We believe in:

- Local-first design
- Real-time market intelligence
- Human + AI cooperation
- Elegant code over bloated cloud
- Quiet, precise execution

What you're looking at is a public fragment — made visible **by choice**.

## 🧪 What's Here

- 📊 A lightweight chart renderer (Flask + Plotly)
- 📁 Sample market data (mock engine)
- 🧰 Basic toggles (volume, intervals, chart type)
- 🔄 Manual-safe Git sync logic

---

## 🚫 What's Not Here

- No API keys  
- No AI cores  
- No strategies  
- No memory  
- No noise
